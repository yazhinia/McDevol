MetaDevol - Metagenome binning based on Deconvolution of abundance and k-mer profiles. 

Shown below an illustration for the underlying basis for binning.
(1) Contigs originated from same genome will have correlated abundance profiles across samples;
(2) k-mer (tetramer) frequency is a characteristics of microbial genomes and distinguishes genomes from different genus. Thus, contigs from same genome show correlation in k-mer frequency.
